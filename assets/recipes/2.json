My husband swears it's better than any takeout version he's ever had. It's not so dry and the ratio of rice to veggies and egg is more proportionate. Plus, the oyster sauce and sesame oil make all the difference in terms of flavor. I'\r\n\r\nDon't judge, but I add chopped bacon along with the veggies and cook until bacon is just barely getting crispy."},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lynn Rolaf"},"datePublished":"2021-10-26","reviewBody":"This is my absolute favorite recipe for Fried Rice.

I've seen some that read like a Master Chef instructors manual, with lingo and skills NO ONE NEEDS TO MAKE FRIED RICE \ud83d\ude02\r\nSo kudos on this recipe it's a absolute must try! \r\n5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marshall"},"datePublished":"2021-10-27","reviewBody":"Very yummy.

I followed the recipe as it was for the most part, with just a few minor additions/modifications/notes:\r\n1. I didn't have leftover rice, so I made a fresh batch and popped it in the freezer to cool;\r\n2. I used some leftover scrambled eggs I had in the fridge, I just chopped them up;\r\n3. I used some leftover Char Sui pork, about 4 cups, chopped;\r\n4. I used frozen peas and carrots, and didn't have an onion so I omitted that;\r\n5. I ended up using 4 green onions, about 1 tbsp of sesame oil, and 4-6 tbsp of soy sauce at the end.\r\n\r\nGREAT tip on letting the rice sit in between so it gets nice and crispy!  This will definitely be my go-to fried rice recipe!"}],"datePublished":"2017-07-10","@id":"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/#recipe","isPartOf":{"@id":"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/#article"},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/#webpage"}]}
